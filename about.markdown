Hi, I'm Wesley Banfield,

I initially studied as an Engineering Geologist but quickly turned to the dark side of programming. 

I'm passionate about getting the latest tech innovations into the hands of geologists to make their lives easier. As such I'm always on the look out for cool new solutions and how they can be repurposed for the natural sciences.

I hold collaboration and moving forward close to my heart. I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to present at multiple conferences and even dabble in writing a book, as well as generally participation in open source projects.
